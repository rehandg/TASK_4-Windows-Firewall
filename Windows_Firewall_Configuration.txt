8. Summary: How a Firewall Filters Traffic
------------------------------------------

A firewall filters traffic by enforcing a set of rules that inspect network packets. Each packet contains metadata such as:

- Source & Destination IP addresses
- Source & Destination Ports
- Protocol type (TCP, UDP, ICMP, etc.)
- Associated application or service

The firewall applies rules in order:

1. Matches a rule?
   - If it matches a block rule, the traffic is discarded.
   - If it matches an allow rule, the traffic is accepted.
2. No matching rule?
   - The default policy (usually allow or block) takes effect.

Windows Firewall supports:
- Inbound rules – filter traffic coming into your system.
- Outbound rules – filter traffic leaving your system.
- Program, Port, Protocol, or IP-based rules.

This filtering ensures that:
- Only trusted, expected communication happens.
- Malicious or unauthorized access is blocked.
- Local services (like file sharing) are restricted to secure zones (like the LAN).
